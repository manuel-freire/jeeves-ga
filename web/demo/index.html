        <p>
            Jeeves is a simple Genetic Algorithm library written in JavaScript.
            The following demos should help you get started.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="closest.html">closest</a>: 
				finds the closest 2d coordinate to (.5, .5), starting from a set of
				random points in the square (0,0)-(2,2) and using "midpoints" as
				crossover function.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="presents.html">presents</a>: 
                finds an allocation of presents between 4 families such that everyone gives and receives 2 presents, 
                people do not give presents to their own families (including themselves), and they never give presents
                twice to the same person. Other restrictions could be easily be coded in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="nucleo.html">nucleo</a>: 
                used within an experimental moodle plugin; creates collaborative groups of students so that the total grades
                of groups are as balanced as possible, while taking into account pairwise "dislikes" between students
                (after working with a colleague, they can add it to their "do not want to work with again" list).
            </li>
        </ul>
